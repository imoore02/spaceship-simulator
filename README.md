# ðŸš€ 3D Spaceship Simulation

This project is a **3D graphics rendering engine** implementing the **projective graphics pipeline** using C++ and OpenGL, featuring:  
- **Real-time terrain rendering**  
- **3D spaceship and launchpad models**  
- **Animation, camera tracking, and lighting effects**  

It utilizes computer graphics algorithms for rendering, including **Bresenhamâ€™s line drawing, triangle rasterization, and instancing**.  

## ðŸŽ® Features  
âœ… **3D Graphics Rendering** â€“ Implements the **projective graphics pipeline** for realistic rendering.  
âœ… **Custom Terrain Generation** â€“ Procedural terrain rendering with **textures and shading**.  
âœ… **Spaceship & Launchpad Models** â€“ Designed with **animation and dynamic camera tracking**.  
âœ… **Optimized Rendering** â€“ Uses **Bresenhamâ€™s line algorithm, triangle rasterization**, and instancing for performance.  
âœ… **Interactive Camera** â€“ Allows **movement, zooming, and rotation** for enhanced user experience.    

## ðŸš€ How It Works  
The **spaceship simulation** follows a structured graphics pipeline:  
1. **Object Modeling** â€“ Spaceship and terrain are modeled using **vertex and fragment shaders**.  
2. **Rasterization** â€“ Uses **Bresenhamâ€™s algorithm and triangle rasterization** for rendering.  
3. **Lighting & Texturing** â€“ Implements **Phong lighting** and texture mapping for realism.  
4. **Camera & Animation** â€“ Features **dynamic camera tracking** and **object instancing** for performance.  

## ðŸ“Š Performance Optimizations  
- **Triangle Rasterization** â€“ Efficiently handles large 3D models with minimal processing overhead.  
- **Instancing** â€“ Reduces the number of draw calls for complex objects.  
- **Texture Compression** â€“ Optimized texture loading for faster rendering.
